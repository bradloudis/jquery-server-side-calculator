Creating a calculator web application. A user can enter 2 numbers in the input fields and select a math operator (+ , - , \* , /). If a user clicks the **equals** button the calculation is sent to be computed on the server. The server then provides the answer and it is displayed on the page. If a user clicks the **clear** button the calculator will clear all inputs. A user will be alerted if they do not fill out both input fields and select a math operator.
